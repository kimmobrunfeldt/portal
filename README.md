# Portal

Real life portal controlled with Leap Motion. This is a quick and fun hack made for our office party.


## Get started

You need two computers with web cameras and optionally a Leap Motion.

* *(Optional)* [Install Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup).
* Open https://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/portal in Chrome browser in computer 1.

    This will generate a new *host* portal and the URL will change to have an id.

* Copy paste the URL from computer 1's browser to Chrome in computer 2.

After that, the second computer will connect to the *host* portal and video connection is made.
